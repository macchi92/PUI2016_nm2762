I WORKED WITH hrafnkell hjorleifsson FOR THE Tasks


I just see that I missed a few lines at the end of the notebook. I didn't save before uploading it so I this few lines are missing.




# looking at frequency
1/np.fft.rfftfreq(N, 1.0)

# creating a list and filling it with the values of interest
powerlist = []
for i in range(0, len(mta_allsum_types)):
    powerlist.append(np.abs(np.fft.rfft(mta_allsum_types[i]))[4])
    
    # creating a dataframe with the values of the list
power_df = pd.DataFrame(powerlist)
power_df.rename(columns={0 : "power"}, inplace=True)

#sorting stations by annual periodicity, showing top4
power_df.sort(columns='power', ascending=False).head(4)

### The four stations with the highest seasonal periodicity are stations 0, 194, 150 and 327.
